# UVa Epic Physician Builder Pilot Proposal

Chris Dampier  
Surgery, PGY3

## Motivation

The electronic medical record (EHR) has become an integral part of healthcare delivery. Currently, many academic medical centers use a proprietary software owned by [Epic Systems Corporation](https://www.epic.com/). Epic's software has an overwhelming number of useful features, many of which are not fully exploited by clinically-active physicians at UVa (and likely elsewhere). Furthermore, clinically-active physicians at UVa (and likely elsewhere) possess expert knowledge that is not currently exploited in the implementation of Epic's software. The goals of the Physician Builder Pilot are:

  * To educate a core group of clinically-active physicians at UVa on the breadth and depth of Epic's software so that they might translate software capabilities into safer, more efficient healthcare delivery
  * To empower a core group of clinically-active physicians at UVa to improve Epic's software so that it facilitates safer, more efficient healthcare delivery

## Short term goals

  * Obtain Epic [Physician Builder Certification](https://training.epic.com/CourseCatalog/#/?LocationID=1&VersionID=1194&ViewID=train-tracks&RoleID=14&TrackID=57)
    * Epic Basic Course 5/21-5/24
    * Epic Advanced Course 7/16-7/18
  * Improve and standardize UVa Department of Surgery note templates

### Time commitment

  * Present date until May 2020 (when I go back to clinical rotations)
  * 10 hours per week

## Medium term goals

  * Publish a study in the field of implementation science
    * Implement new UVa diet order and measure number of instances of oral medications ordered for patients unable to take oral medications (this project is sponsored by UVa Department of Neurology)
    * Implement UVa Department of Surgery note templates and measure time to completion or clicks required for consults/clinic visits
    * Implement [ACS Surgical Risk Calculator](https://riskcalculator.facs.org/RiskCalculator/) within pre-op visit Epic workflow and measure patient-reported perceptions/outcomes
    * Implement VAP abx selection/duration tool to flag inadequate/inappropriate abx orders in the SICU and measure time of under/over-prescription relative to guidelines
    * Implement DVT prophylaxis order review tool to flag inadequate/inappropriate prophylaxis orders in surgical patients and measure number of instances of discrepancies relative to guidelines
    * Implement a tube feed order bot to calculate caloric requirements, formula, and rate and measure time to completion or clicks required for new nutrition consults
  * Obtain additional Epic Certifications
    * Physician Builder Analytics
    * Physician Builder Healthy Planet
    * Clinical Data Model for Physician Builders

## Long term goals

  * Establish a translational bioinformatics research program to translate advances in computer science and computational biology into improvements in healthcare delivery
    * Polygenic risk score implementation within the EHR and typical clinical workflow
    * Natural language processing or rule-based tool development for automation of initial visits in the surgical clinic
  * Strengthen the open-source healthcare software development community to offer advanced bioinformatics solutions to more health systems nationally and globally
  * Obtain Epic Programmer Certifications

## Miscellaneous projects

  * extract diagnosis codes with sql, study similarity between resident and attending diagnosis
  * extract diagnosis codes with sql, study similarity between ICU and primary team diagnosis
  * extract diagnosis codes with sql, study similarity between consult and primary team diagnosis
