# SmartStart for Residents

## Intern Epic Onboarding

### Computer-based learning
* Overview, goals, terminology
* See nurse and attending interfaces in addition to resident interface
* See what lab order looks like for nurse, lab, and ordering provider
* See what image order looks like for nurse, radiology, and ordering provider
* See what med order looks like for nurse, pharmacy, and ordering provider

### Classroom
* As limited as possible
* Log-in, make a list, place an order, find a result, start a note
* Reference materials in searchable repository

### Peer Training
* Transfer of key templates/order sets/workflows to interns
* Education chief as coordinator
* PGY2 as peer trainer

### Additional goals
* Curated digital resources/workflows
* Discovery: what to measure ...

### Issues
* What about the ED people rotating on Gen Med, etc
* Why not just give us the templates
* Ongoing training throughout year vs throughout residency program
* Pathology should keep their own program
* Z: drive sets of templates in Pathology; a model for other programs
* Solicit templates from residents
