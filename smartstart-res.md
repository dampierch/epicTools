# SmartStart for Residents

## Intern Epic Onboarding

### Computer-based learning
* Overview, goals, terminology
* See nurse and attending interfaces in addition to resident interface
* See what lab order looks like for nurse, lab, and ordering provider
* See what image order looks like for nurse, radiology, and ordering provider
* See what med order looks like for nurse, pharmacy, and ordering provider

### Classroom
* As limited as possible
* Log-in, make a list, place an order, find a result, start a note
* Reference materials in searchable repository

### Peer Training
* Transfer of key templates/order sets/workflows to interns
* Education chief as coordinator
* PGY2 as peer trainer

### Additional goals
* Curated digital resources/workflows
* Discovery: what to measure ...

### Issues
* Concerns about how to onboard ED residents rotating on Gen Med, etc
* Interest in on-going training throughout the year and throughout residency
* Sample non-rhetorical feedback: Why not just give us the templates for all the departments we rotate in?
* Suggestion: solicit templates from residents and aggregate them in centralized resource repository
* Of note, Pathology appears to be unique in having a specialized and effective onboarding currently in place; Pathology should keep their current program and perhaps serve as a model for others
* Pathology keeps a resident- and potentially attending-curated set of templates on the Z: drive; could be a model for other programs
