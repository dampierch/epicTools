# epicTools repository

## Introduction

This is a repo to store and version my scripts for clinical informatics
applications. Right now, I have only R and Python scripts, and I am not
sure how to integrate them into Epic or other EHRs. In the future, I will learn how
to integrate them, and I will develop more.
